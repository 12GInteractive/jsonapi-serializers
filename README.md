[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/jsonapi-serializers.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/jsonapi-serializers)


JSONAPI::Serializers is a simple library for serializing Ruby objects and their relationships into the [JSON:API format](http://jsonapi.org/format/).

As of writing, the JSON:API spec is approaching v1 and still undergoing changes. This library supports RC3+ and aims to keep up with the continuing development changes.

## Features

* Works with **any Ruby web framework**, including Rails, Sinatra, etc. This is a pure Ruby library.
* Supports the readonly features of the JSON:API spec.
  * **Full support for compound documents** ("side-loading") and the `include` parameter.
* Similar interface to ActiveModel::Serializers, should provide an easy migration path.
* Intentionally unopinionated and simple, allows you to structure your app however you would like and then serialize the objects at the end.

JSONAPI::Serializers was built as an intentionally simple serialization interface. It makes no assumptions about your database structure or routes and it does not provide controllers or any create/update interface to the objects. It is a library, not a framework. You will probably still need to do work to make your API fully compliant with the nuances of the [JSON:API spec](http://jsonapi.org/format/), for things like supporting `/links` routes and for supporting write actions like creating or updating objects. If you are looking for a more complete and opinionated framework, see the [jsonapi-resources](https://github.com/cerebris/jsonapi-resources) project.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'jsonapi-serializers'
```

Or install directly with `gem install jsonapi-serializers`.

## Usage

### Define a serializer

```ruby
require 'jsonapi-serializers'

class PostSerializer
  include JSONAPI::Serializer
  
  attribute :title
  attribute :content
end
```

### Serialize an object

```ruby
JSONAPI::Serializer.serialize(post)
```

Returns a hash:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "1",
    "type": "posts",
    "attributes": {
      "title": "Hello World",
      "content": "Your first post"
    },
    "links": {
      "self": "/posts/1"
    }
  }
}
```

### Serialize a collection

```ruby
JSONAPI::Serializer.serialize(posts, is_collection: true)
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "type": "posts",
      "attributes": {
        "title": "Hello World",
        "content": "Your first post"
      },
      "links": {
        "self": "/posts/1"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "2",
      "type": "posts",
      "attributes": {
        "title": "Hello World again",
        "content": "Your second post"
      },
      "links": {
        "self": "/posts/2"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

You must always pass `is_collection: true` when serializing a collection, see [Null handling](#null-handling).

### Null handling

```ruby
JSONAPI::Serializer.serialize(nil)
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "data": null
}
```

And serializing an empty collection:
```ruby
JSONAPI::Serializer.serialize([], is_collection: true)
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "data": []
}
```

Note that the JSON:API spec distinguishes in how null/empty is handled for single objects vs. collections, so you must always provide `is_collection: true` when serializing multiple objects. If you attempt to serialize multiple objects without this flag (or a single object with it on) a `JSONAPI::Serializer::AmbiguousCollectionError` will be raised.

### Custom attributes

By default the serializer looks for the same name of the attribute on the object it is given. You can customize this behavior by providing a block to the attribute:

```ruby
  attribute :content do
    object.body
  end
```

The block is evaluated within the serializer instance, so it has access to the `object` and `context` instance variables.

### More customizations

Many other formatting and customizations are possible by overriding any of the following instance methods on your serializers.

```ruby
# Override this to customize the JSON:API "id" for this object.
# Always return a string from this method to conform with the JSON:API spec.
def id
  object.id.to_s
end
```
```ruby
# Override this to customize the JSON:API "type" for this object.
# By default, the type is the object's class name lowercased, pluralized, and dasherized,
# per the spec naming recommendations: http://jsonapi.org/recommendations/#naming
# For example, 'MyApp::LongCommment' will become the 'long-comments' type.
def type
  object.class.name.demodulize.tableize.dasherize
end
```
```ruby
# Override this to customize how attribute names are formatted.
# By default, attribute names are dasherized per the spec naming recommendations:
# http://jsonapi.org/recommendations/#naming
def format_name(attribute_name)
  attribute_name.to_s.dasherize
end
```
```ruby
# The opposite of format_name. Override this if you override format_name.
def unformat_name(attribute_name)
  attribute_name.to_s.underscore
end
```
```ruby
# Override this to provide resource-object metadata.
# http://jsonapi.org/format/#document-structure-resource-objects
def meta
end
```
```ruby
def self_link
  "/#{type}/#{id}"
end
```
```ruby
def relationship_self_link(attribute_name)
  "#{self_link}/links/#{format_name(attribute_name)}"
end
```
```ruby
def relationship_related_link(attribute_name)
  "#{self_link}/#{format_name(attribute_name)}"
end
```

## Relationships

You can easily specify relationships with the `has_one` and `has_many` directives.

```ruby
class BaseSerializer
  include JSONAPI::Serializer
end

class PostSerializer < BaseSerializer
  attribute :title
  attribute :content

  has_one :author
  has_many :comments
end

class UserSerializer < BaseSerializer
  attribute :name
end

class CommentSerializer < BaseSerializer
  attribute :content

  has_one :user
end
```

Note that when serializing a post, the `author` association will come from the `author` attribute on the `Post` instance, no matter what type it is (in this case it is a `User`). This will work just fine, because JSONAPI::Serializers automatically finds serializer classes by appending `Serializer` to the object's class name. This behavior can be customized.

Because the full class name is used when discovering serializers, JSONAPI::Serializers works with any custom namespaces you might have, like a Rails Engine or standard Ruby module namespace.

### Compound documents and includes

> To reduce the number of HTTP requests, servers MAY allow responses that include related resources along with the requested primary resources. Such responses are called "compound documents".
> [JSON:API Compound Documents](http://jsonapi.org/format/#document-structure-compound-documents)

JSONAPI::Serializers supports compound documents with a simple `include` parameter.

For example:

```ruby
JSONAPI::Serializer.serialize(post, include: ['author', 'comments', 'comments.user'])
```

Returns:

```json

  "data": {
    "id": "1",
    "type": "posts",
    "attributes": {
      "title": "Hello World",
      "content": "Your first post"
    },
    "links": {
      "self": "/posts/1",
      "author": {
        "self": "/posts/1/links/author",
        "related": "/posts/1/author",
        "linkage": {
          "type": "users",
          "id": "1"
        }
      },
      "comments": {
        "self": "/posts/1/links/comments",
        "related": "/posts/1/comments",
        "linkage": [
          {
            "type": "comments",
            "id": "1"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  "included": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "type": "users",
      "attributes": {
        "name": "Post Author"
      },
      "links": {
        "self": "/users/1"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "1",
      "type": "comments",
      "attributes": {
        "content": "Have no fear, sers, your king is safe."
      },
      "links": {
        "self": "/comments/1",
        "user": {
          "self": "/comments/1/links/user",
          "related": "/comments/1/user",
          "linkage": {
            "type": "users",
            "id": "2"
          }
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "2",
      "type": "users",
      "attributes": {
        "name": "Barristan Selmy"
      },
      "links": {
        "self": "/users/2"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Notice a few things:
* The [primary data](http://jsonapi.org/format/#document-structure-top-level) now includes "linkage" information for each relationship that was included.
* The related objects themselves are loaded in the top-level `included` member.
* The related objects _also_ include "linkage" information when a deeper relationship is also present in the compound document. This is a very powerful feature of the JSON:API spec, and allows you to deeply link complicated relationships all in the same document and in a single HTTP response. JSONAPI::Serializers automatically includes the correct linkage information for whatever `include` paths you specify. This conforms to this part of the spec:
    
  > Note: Resource linkage in a compound document allows a client to link together all of the included resource objects without having to GET any relationship URLs.
  > [JSON:API Resource Relationships](http://jsonapi.org/format/#document-structure-resource-relationships)

#### Relationship path handling
 
The `include` param also accepts a string of [relationship paths](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-includes), ie. `include: 'author,comments,comments.user'` so you can pass an `?include` query param directly through to the serialize method. Be aware that letting users pass arbitrary relationship paths might introduce security issues depending on your authorization setup, where a user could `include` a relationship they might not be authorized to see directly. Be aware of what you allow API users to include.

## Rails example

```ruby
# app/serializers/base_serializer.rb
class BaseSerializer
  include JSONAPI::Serializer

  def self_link
    "/api/v1#{super}"
  end
end

# app/serializers/post_serializer.rb
class PostSerializer < BaseSerializer
  attribute :title
  attribute :content
end

# app/controllers/api/v1/base_controller.rb
class Api::V1::BaseController < ActionController::Base
  # Convenience methods for serializing models:
  def serialize_model(model, options = {})
    options[:is_collection] = false
    JSONAPI::Serializer.serialize(model, options)
  end

  def serialize_models(models, options = {})
    options[:is_collection] = true
    JSONAPI::Serializer.serialize(models, options)
  end
end

# app/controllers/api/v1/posts_controller.rb
class Api::V1::ReposController < Api::V1::BaseController
  def index
    posts = Post.all
    render json: serialize_models(posts)
  end

  def show
    post = Post.find(params[:id])
    render json: serialize_model(post)
  end
end

# lib/jsonapi_mimetypes.rb
# Without this mimetype registration, controllers will not automatically parse JSON API params.
module JSONAPI
  MIMETYPE = "application/vnd.api+json"
end
Mime::Type.register(JSONAPI::MIMETYPE, :api_json)
ActionDispatch::ParamsParser::DEFAULT_PARSERS[Mime::Type.lookup(JSONAPI::MIMETYPE)] = lambda do |body|
  JSON.parse(body)
end
```

## Unfinished business

* Support for passing `context` through to serializers is partially complete, but needs more work.
* Support for a `serializer_class` attribute on objects that overrides serializer discovery, would love a PR contribution for this.
* Support for the `fields` spec is planned, would love a PR contribution for this.
* Support for pagination/sorting is unlikely to be supported because it would likely involve coupling to ActiveRecord, but please open an issue if you have ideas of how to support this generically.
